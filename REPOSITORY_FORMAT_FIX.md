# Repository Format Fix - GitHub Actions Checkout

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

**Problem:** GitHub Actions `checkout` action was failing with:
```
Error: Invalid repository 'https://github.com/rishanimates/auth-service.git'. 
Expected format {owner}/{repo}.
```

**Root Cause:** GitHub Actions expects repository format as `owner/repo`, not full HTTPS URLs.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Fixed service-repositories.json**
```json
// ❌ BEFORE (Incorrect)
"repository": "https://github.com/rishanimates/auth-service.git"

// ✅ AFTER (Correct)  
"repository": "rishanimates/auth-service"
```

### 2. **Regenerated Webhook Workflows**
- All service webhook workflows now use correct format
- Webhook dispatch points to `rishanimates/deployment` (not service repos)
- Service repo references use `rishanimates/{service-name}` format

### 3. **Updated Configuration**
- Organization: `rishanimates`
- Deployment repository: `rishanimates/deployment`
- All services configured for `develop` branch → staging

## 📋 **Current Configuration**

### Service Repositories (owner/repo format):
- `rishanimates/auth-service`
- `rishanimates/user-service` 
- `rishanimates/chat-service`
- `rishanimates/event-service`
- `rishanimates/shared-service`
- `rishanimates/splitz-service`

### Deployment Flow:
```
Service Repo (develop) → Webhook → rishanimates/deployment → Auto Deploy → Staging VPS
```

## 🚀 **Webhook Setup Process**

### Step 1: Create GitHub Personal Access Token
1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Create token with `repo` and `workflow` permissions
3. Copy the token

### Step 2: Add Token to Each Service Repository
For each service repository (`rishanimates/auth-service`, etc.):
1. Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add secret: `DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN` = `<your_token>`

### Step 3: Install Webhook in Service Repositories
```bash
# In each service repository directory
cp ../deployment/setup-service-webhooks.sh .
./setup-service-webhooks.sh

# Commit the webhook
git add .github/workflows/deploy-on-merge.yml
git commit -m "Add automatic deployment webhook"
git push origin main
```

## 🔍 **Testing the Setup**

### Verify Configuration:
```bash
cd deployment
./test-webhook-setup.sh
```

### Test Staging Deployment:
```bash
# In any service repository
git checkout develop
echo "# Test change" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test staging deployment"
git push origin develop
# 🚀 Should trigger automatic staging deployment
```

## 📊 **Deployment Matrix**

| Branch | Environment | Trigger | Repository Format |
|--------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| develop | staging | Auto | `rishanimates/service-name` |
| main | production | Auto | `rishanimates/service-name` |

## ✅ **Verification Checklist**

- [x] Repository format uses `owner/repo` (not HTTPS URLs)
- [x] Webhooks point to deployment repository
- [x] All services configured for develop branch
- [x] Webhook workflows generated correctly
- [x] Main deployment workflows updated
- [x] Test script passes all checks

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

When you push to `develop` branch in any service repository:

1. **Service Repository:** Webhook workflow triggers
2. **Deployment Repository:** `auto-deploy-staging.yml` runs
3. **GitHub Actions:** Checks out service code using `owner/repo` format
4. **Build:** Creates Docker image for the service
5. **Deploy:** Deploys to staging VPS (103.168.19.241)
6. **Health Check:** Verifies service is running

---

**🎉 The repository format issue is now fixed! GitHub Actions will correctly checkout service repositories using the proper `owner/repo` format.**
