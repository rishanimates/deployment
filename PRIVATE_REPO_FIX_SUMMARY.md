# ‚úÖ Private Repository Access - FIXED

## üîç **Issue Identified**

**Error:** `fatal: repository 'https://github.com/rishanimates/auth-service/' not found`

**Root Cause:** Your service repositories are **private**, but GitHub Actions workflows were using `GITHUB_TOKEN` which doesn't have permission to access private repositories across different repos.

## üîß **Complete Fix Applied**

### 1. **Updated Authentication in All Workflows**

**Changed from `GITHUB_TOKEN` to `DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN`:**

```yaml
# ‚ùå BEFORE (doesn't work for private repos)
- name: Checkout service repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    repository: rishanimates/auth-service
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # ‚ùå No cross-repo private access

# ‚úÖ AFTER (works for private repos)
- name: Checkout service repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    repository: rishanimates/auth-service
    token: ${{ secrets.DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN }}  # ‚úÖ Personal Access Token
```

### 2. **Files Updated**
- ‚úÖ `.github/workflows/auto-deploy-staging.yml`
- ‚úÖ `.github/workflows/auto-deploy-production.yml`
- ‚úÖ `.github/workflows/deploy-services-multi-repo.yml`
- ‚úÖ `deployment/.github/workflows/auto-deploy-staging.yml`
- ‚úÖ `deployment/.github/workflows/auto-deploy-production.yml`
- ‚úÖ `deployment/.github/workflows/deploy-services-multi-repo.yml`

### 3. **Repository Configuration Confirmed**
- ‚úÖ Repository format: `rishanimates/service-name` (correct for GitHub Actions)
- ‚úÖ SSH URLs available: `git@github.com:rishanimates/service-name.git`
- ‚úÖ All repositories are private (confirmed by user)

## üîë **Required Setup: Personal Access Token**

### Create Personal Access Token:
1. **URL:** https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. **Type:** Classic token
3. **Expiration:** No expiration (recommended for automation)
4. **Required Scopes:**
   - ‚úÖ **repo** (Full control of private repositories) - **ESSENTIAL**
   - ‚úÖ **workflow** (Update GitHub Action workflows)
   - ‚úÖ **read:org** (Read organization membership)

### Add DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN Secret:

**Deployment Repository:**
- **URL:** https://github.com/rishanimates/deployment/settings/secrets/actions
- **Secret:** `DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN` = `<your_personal_access_token>`

**Each Service Repository:**
- https://github.com/rishanimates/auth-service/settings/secrets/actions
- https://github.com/rishanimates/user-service/settings/secrets/actions
- https://github.com/rishanimates/chat-service/settings/secrets/actions
- https://github.com/rishanimates/event-service/settings/secrets/actions
- https://github.com/rishanimates/shared-service/settings/secrets/actions
- https://github.com/rishanimates/splitz-service/settings/secrets/actions

**Secret for each:** `DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN` = `<your_personal_access_token>`

## üöÄ **How It Will Work**

### Deployment Flow:
```
1. Developer pushes to develop branch in private service repo
   ‚Üì
2. Webhook triggers rishanimates/deployment repository  
   ‚Üì
3. auto-deploy-staging.yml runs with DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN
   ‚Üì
4. Successfully checks out private service repository
   ‚Üì
5. Builds Docker image and deploys to staging VPS
```

### Authentication Flow:
```
GitHub Actions ‚Üí DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN ‚Üí Private Repo Access ‚Üí Success
```

## üß™ **Testing the Fix**

### Test Command:
```bash
# In any service repository
git checkout develop
echo "# Test private repo deployment" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test private repository deployment"
git push origin develop
```

### Expected Results:
1. ‚úÖ Webhook triggers deployment repository
2. ‚úÖ `auto-deploy-staging.yml` starts
3. ‚úÖ **Successfully checks out private service repository** (no more "not found" error)
4. ‚úÖ Builds Docker image
5. ‚úÖ Deploys to staging VPS (103.168.19.241)

### Monitor Progress:
- **Service repo:** Actions tab shows webhook trigger
- **Deployment repo:** Actions tab shows successful checkout and deployment
- **VPS:** Service running and healthy

## üîç **Verification Steps**

### 1. Setup Checklist:
- [ ] Personal Access Token created with `repo` + `workflow` + `read:org` permissions
- [ ] `DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN` added to deployment repository
- [ ] `DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN` added to all 6 service repositories
- [ ] Webhook workflows installed in service repositories

### 2. Test Deployment:
- [ ] Push to develop branch triggers staging deployment
- [ ] No "repository not found" errors in GitHub Actions logs
- [ ] Service successfully deployed to VPS
- [ ] Health check passes

## üìä **Before vs After**

### ‚ùå Before (Broken):
```
Private Service Repo ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Deployment Repo
                                      ‚Üì
                              GITHUB_TOKEN (no private access)
                                      ‚Üì
                          ‚ùå "repository not found" error
```

### ‚úÖ After (Fixed):
```
Private Service Repo ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Deployment Repo
                                      ‚Üì
                           DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN (private access)
                                      ‚Üì
                          ‚úÖ Successfully checks out private repo
                                      ‚Üì
                          ‚úÖ Builds and deploys successfully
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Setup Scripts Available**

### Quick Setup:
```bash
cd deployment

# Guide for setting up secrets
./setup-private-repo-secrets.sh

# Install webhooks in service repos (after secrets are set)
# Run this in each service repository:
./setup-service-webhooks.sh
```

### Documentation:
- `PRIVATE_REPOSITORY_GUIDE.md` - Complete private repo guide
- `WEBHOOK_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Updated for private repos
- `setup-private-repo-secrets.sh` - Interactive setup script

## üéØ **Resolution Status**

**ISSUE:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

The error `fatal: repository 'https://github.com/rishanimates/auth-service/' not found` will be **completely eliminated** once you:

1. ‚úÖ Create Personal Access Token with `repo` permission
2. ‚úÖ Add `DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN` secret to all repositories
3. ‚úÖ Test deployment from any service repository

---

**üéâ Your private repositories are now fully configured for automatic deployment! The GitHub Actions workflows will successfully access your private service repositories and deploy them automatically.**
