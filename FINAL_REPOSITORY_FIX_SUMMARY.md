# ✅ Repository Format Issue - RESOLVED

## 🔍 **Problem**
GitHub Actions `checkout@v4` was failing with:
```
Error: Invalid repository 'https://github.com/rishanimates/auth-service.git'. 
Expected format {owner}/{repo}.
```

## 🔧 **Root Cause**
GitHub Actions expects repository format as `owner/repo`, but configurations were using full HTTPS URLs.

## ✅ **Complete Fix Applied**

### 1. **Fixed service-repositories.json**
```json
// ❌ BEFORE
"repository": "https://github.com/rishanimates/auth-service.git"

// ✅ AFTER  
"repository": "rishanimates/auth-service"
```

### 2. **Updated Multi-Repository Workflow**
Fixed `deploy-services-multi-repo.yml`:
```yaml
# ❌ BEFORE
["auth-service"]="https://github.com/rishanimates/auth-service.git"

# ✅ AFTER
["auth-service"]="rishanimates/auth-service"
```

### 3. **Updated Default Branch**
Changed from `main` to `develop` for staging deployments:
```yaml
# ❌ BEFORE
branch="${SERVICE_BRANCHES[$service]:-main}"

# ✅ AFTER
branch="${SERVICE_BRANCHES[$service]:-develop}"
```

### 4. **Regenerated Webhook Workflows**
All service webhook workflows now use:
- Dispatch repository: `rishanimates/deployment`
- Service repository: `rishanimates/{service-name}`

### 5. **Cleaned Up Backup Files**
Removed old backup files containing HTTPS URLs.

## 🔍 **Verification Completed**

**Verification Script Results:**
```
✅ All Repository Formats Verified!
• No HTTPS URLs found in any workflow files
• Webhook dispatch: rishanimates/deployment (✅ Correct)
• Service repos: rishanimates/{service-name} (✅ Correct)
• Repository format: owner/repo (✅ Correct)
```

## 📋 **Current Configuration**

### Repository Format:
- **Organization:** `rishanimates`
- **Deployment repo:** `rishanimates/deployment`
- **Service repos:** 
  - `rishanimates/auth-service`
  - `rishanimates/user-service`
  - `rishanimates/chat-service`
  - `rishanimates/event-service`
  - `rishanimates/shared-service`
  - `rishanimates/splitz-service`

### Branch Configuration:
- **Default branch:** `develop` (staging)
- **Production branch:** `main`

## 🚀 **Expected GitHub Actions Behavior**

### ✅ What Will Work Now:
```yaml
- name: Checkout service repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    repository: rishanimates/auth-service  # ✅ Correct format
    ref: develop
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    path: service-code
```

### ❌ What Was Failing Before:
```yaml
- name: Checkout service repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    repository: https://github.com/rishanimates/auth-service.git  # ❌ Wrong format
    ref: develop
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    path: service-code
```

## 🎯 **Deployment Flow**

### Staging (develop branch):
```
Service Repo (develop) → Webhook → rishanimates/deployment → Auto Deploy → Staging VPS
```

### Production (main branch):
```
Service Repo (main) → Webhook → rishanimates/deployment → Auto Deploy → Production VPS
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### Test Staging Deployment:
```bash
# In any service repository
git checkout develop
echo "# Test change" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test staging deployment"
git push origin develop
# 🚀 Should trigger automatic staging deployment WITHOUT checkout errors
```

### Manual Workflow Test:
```bash
# GitHub Actions → Deploy Services (Multi-Repository) → Run workflow
# Select services and develop branch
# Should work without repository format errors
```

## 📊 **Files Modified**

### Configuration Files:
- ✅ `deployment/service-repositories.json`
- ✅ `deployment/.github/workflows/deploy-services-multi-repo.yml`
- ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy-services-multi-repo.yml`

### Webhook Files:
- ✅ All service webhook workflows in `service-webhook-workflows/`

### Cleanup:
- 🗑️ Removed backup files with old HTTPS URLs

## 🎉 **Resolution Status**

**ISSUE:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

The GitHub Actions checkout error:
```
Error: Invalid repository 'https://github.com/rishanimates/auth-service.git'. 
Expected format {owner}/{repo}.
```

**Will no longer occur** because all repository references now use the correct `owner/repo` format.

**🚀 Your automatic deployment system is now ready to work without repository format errors!**
